            Perhaps travel cannot prevent bigotry, but by demonstrating that all peoples cry, laugh, eat, worry, and
            die, it can introduce the idea that if we try and understand each other, we may even become friends. - Maya

            <br>England's reach across popular culture is so vast that you may think you already know the country before
            you
            visit.</br>
            <br>However, if you expect to be surrounded by well-heeled James Bonds or a gaggle of eccentric Monty Python
            characters, think again.</br>
            <br>While the everyday English aren't quite the same as how they're portrayed in film, television and books,
            this country has a number of peculiarities that are good to know before visiting, especially when venturing
            outside of London. From practicalities like train prices to etiquette tips on how the English approach
            queueing, it's always important to be ahead of the game when visiting this wonderful and varied
            country.</br>
            <br>Here are some key things to know before traveling to England.</br>

        <h2>Tip #1: You should pack a jacket, even in summer</h2>
        <div class="divide">
            <p>
                While you can visit England year-round, the best time to visit is during late spring (May - June) and
                early
                autumn (September - October), when the weather is mild and the tourist crowds are thinner. Even in these
                agreeable seasons, England has a reputation for unpredictable weather.</p>

            <p>Preparing for all types of weather is essential to the English experience. England's maritime
                location
                in
                the wild North Atlantic means that even in summer, biting winds and untimely rain showers can
                unexpectedly
                scupper a balmy afternoon.</p>

            <p>That doesn't mean you need to take an umbrella everywhere, but you do need to put a jacket in your
                suitcase
                and always check the conditions on your favorite weather app before venturing out. As a rule, London is
                usually a couple of degrees warmer than other parts of the country.

        <h2>Tip #2: Be ready to discuss the weather </h2>
        <p>
            Talking about the weather is in the English blood and a part of the national psyche. And the more lamentable
            the forecast, the more likely people are to talk about it. Come rain or shine, prepare to offer an opinion
            on the day's weather, and express that it'll hopefully brighten up/cool down as the week goes on.

        <h2>Tip #3: Pronouncing place names will be a challenge </h2>
        <div class="divide">
            <p>
                Alongside some truly bizarre place names, England also has several towns and counties that aren't
                pronounced the way they are spelled.
                Names with a -ter suffix are particularly notorious for this.
                Bicester is pronounced biss-ter rather than bi-ces-ter, Gloucester is pronounced gloss-ter rather
                than glou-ces-ter, Leominster is pronounced lem-ster rather than Leo-minster.
                You get the picture.

        <h2>Tip #4: Carry some cash </h2>
        <p>
            The local currency in England is the British pound (Â£). In the past few years, the number of places
            accepting credit and debit cards, Apple Pay and Google Pay has increased. However, it's still a good idea to
            carry some cash for smaller transactions, particularly in rural areas or for toll gates that aren't
            automated.
