            <h2>1. Brits drink a lot of tea... about 100 million cups every day!</h2>
            <p>The stereotype that the British drink a lot of tea is immediately confirmed with this fun fact.
                They drink around 100-160 million cups of tea daily, which is about 36 billion every year.
                The difference from most of the countries in the world is that almost all the tea drinkers in the UK
                (98%) add milk to their cup of
                tea.</p>

            <h2>2. Stamps originated in the United Kingdom</h2>
            <p>Sending letters was expensive before postage stamps were introduced.
                In May 1840, the first stamp was issued in the UK, it was called 'the Penny Black', and featured Queen
                Victoria.
                The advent of the postage stamp made it cheaper to send letters and caused an increase in sending
                postcards,
                letters and Christmas cards.</p>

            <h2>3. The Queen didn't have a passport</h2>
            <p>
                During her 70 years on the throne, Queen Elizabeth II has visited over 100 countries on official duties.
                Although every person in the world needs an identity card, she does not need a British passport during
                her
                travels. This is because passports are issued in the name of the Queen.

        <h2>4. London has the world's longest-running show </h2>
        <p>
            At St. Martins Theatre in the West End in London, the world's longest-running show is being played. Agatha
            Christie's The Mousetrap has been running since 1952, which means that the show has been running for more
            than 70 years now. The show started as a radio play, called Three Blind Mice, and follows the story of seven
            strangers snowed in at a home in the countryside.

        <h2>5. Cheese rolling is a sport</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, you read it correctly, cheese rolling is a sport. It is estimated that the sport started in the 15th
            century. Once a year, competitors compete in a cheese rolling competition at Cooper's Hill in
            Gloucestershire. During these competitions participants chase a 3.2-kilogram (7lb) wheel of Double
            Gloucester cheese down a steep hill. It is certainly a sport at risk, but it is a tradition not to be missed
            in the region. The winner, the one crossing the finishing line first, wins the wheel of cheese as their
            prize.
